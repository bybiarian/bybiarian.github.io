# Welcome to Safely Queer

This repo is the home to the Safely Queer website code. At this time, Safely Queer does **not** offer direct-to-client services or store information. As a result, we simply serve static site content that helps connect LGBTQ persons in the US with guides to commonly faced issues as we prepare a more robust platform. 

## Mission

Safely Queer is not a non-profit organization, or a formal body of any kind. Right now, we're a website put together by one person. Arian is a 22 year old who has experienced hardships of many kinds before finding professional success, and they want to help ease the transition to independent living for queer people across the US. Additionally, monitoring legislation impacting the community and rhetoric tied to particularly unsafe regions are metrics that will soon be available. 

## Roadmap

We don't always want to be a one-person-show, or even just a simple website. We plan to eventually scale up and become a platform where clients can interact with, submit information to, and communicate securely with organizations who serve them. We also hope to develop a system of accredidation and a safe online community for people to review and share their own experiences with communities and organizations to improve our knowledge base. 

## How can you help?

Please feel free to contact us at *team@safelyqueer.org* with any resources in your own community, insights, or contact information that you think our clients would benefit from. We're not yet looking for developers to flush out an interactive platform, but when that day comes it will be announced both here, and on our website.
